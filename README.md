# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation using Numpy and Pandas
## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Numpy and Pandas. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and gain hands-on experience in their implementation.

## Programs Implemented:

 ### K-Means Algorithm (P1)

Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using Numpy.

### C-Means Algorithm (P2)

Implementation of the C-Means clustering algorithm using Numpy.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (P3)

Implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction using Numpy.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Algorithm (P4)

Implementation of LDA for feature extraction using Numpy.

### Decision Tree Algorithm using ID3 (P5)

Implementation of a decision tree algorithm based on the ID3 algorithm.
Dataset used: Toy Dataset

### Ensemble Learning with Bootstrap Aggregation (P6)

Implementation of ensemble learning using Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging).
Five models generated from random subsets, with majority voting.
Evaluation on a standard imbalanced dataset with train-test splits of 70%-30% and 80%-20%.
Metrics: F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy.
Visualization of the dataset and training/validation of each model.

### K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (P7)

Implementation of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm for different values of 'k'.
Dataset: 'yeast.data' and 'yeast.names' for reference
Train-test split, .csv file generation for model prediction, preprocessing, and visualization.

### Multi-label K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier (P8)

Extension of traditional k-NN for multi-label classification.
Dataset: 'train.csv'
Data Preprocessing, feature extraction/selection, k-fold cross-validation, evaluation using Hamming Loss and F1 score.
Hyperparameter tuning.

### Plant Leaf Disease Classification (P9)

Preprocessing steps: resizing, noise removal, conversion to HSV, and segmentation.
